# Fast tv guide

The goal of this project is to make a tv guide there loads within 500ms on a mobile device (my personal high-end phone).

The project includes a slow normal example of a tv guide in the angular1 folder.

The fast version will be made in the PWA folder and only on enhancement will be add on the plain version at a time, so check the different  branches, it will first be merged when all the different enhancement is made.
